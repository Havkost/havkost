            <span class="body-text">This game is a remake of a flash game named <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=2952">'Beetle Field - The Forecast'</a>. The game was made by Benjamin Soulé for ludum dare 24 in 2012.</span>
            <br>
            <span class="body-text">Since flash was discontinued the 31st december 2020, the original game is no longer accessible by standard web browsers. For this reason we have decided to remake the game with some quite substantial changes.</span>

            <br>
            <span class="body-text">The game is a <strong>single player free to play strategic 2D topdown non-positional unforgiving permadeath autobattler with gambling elements.</strong> The game starts out with two teams of 3 random beetles each as well as two random upgrades. Each turn you vote for the team you think will win. If you're right you go to the next round, where you get to choose an upgrade for the team that lost. This repeats until you guess incorrectly. When this happens the game is over and you can start over.</span>

The caterpillar starts off with a low movementspeed, but as it loses bodyparts, it gains speed. If it loses the middle-part first, it splits into two, what basically equates to two ladybugs.</span>
